# Fastai_Pet_breeds
A neural network which can identify 32 dog breeds and 12 cat breeds. Using the fast ai library


This model was created thanks to :

1. [Fastai library](https://www.fast.ai/).
2. [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/).
3. [Render](https://render.com/)

The [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) by [O. M. Parkhi et al., 2012](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2012parkhi12a/parkhi12a.pdf) which features 12 cat breeds and 25 dogs breeds.


I've added 7 more dog breeds to this dataset and trained a model with 91.292% accuracy.
